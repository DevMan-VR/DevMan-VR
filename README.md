### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Manuel Martinez and im a passionate fullstack engineer from Chile. I have worked both on Startups and Enterprises tackling diverse tech challenges with an agile and lean mindset. Have worked with react since Gatsby was a thing, then i had chance to work with NextJS and also plain ReactJS without any framework. My biggest achieve with ReactJS was being part of the core team that builded a design system for metlife latam in order to unite the visual experience across all metlife latam products. This has teached me to think in the "react way", decomposing complex visual components in smaller an simpler ones, following strongly the principles of Atomic Design. I am ver confident with my frontend skills. I have also had the opportunity to work with GSAP and implement modern animations on the web.

My favorites libraries for react are:
1. GSAP (react)
2. Three.js

I have worked with NextJS and Gatsby.

The following github project is a personal repo where i tried to consolidate a design system for my future frontend projects in order to reuse components.
